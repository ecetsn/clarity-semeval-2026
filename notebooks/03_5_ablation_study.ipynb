        "**Scope:**\n",
        "- **3 Tasks**: Clarity, Evasion, and Hierarchical Evasion → Clarity\n",
        "- **6 Models**: bert, bert_political, bert_ambiguity, roberta, deberta, xlnet\n",
        "- **6 Classifiers**: LogisticRegression, LinearSVC, RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, MLP\n",
        "- **Total Combinations**: 6 models × 6 classifiers = 36 combinations per task\n",
        "\n",
        "**Workflow:**\n",
        "1. Load features and labels from persistent storage (saved by 03_train_evaluate.ipynb)\n",
        "2. Single-Feature Ablation: Evaluate each feature individually across all 36 model×classifier combinations\n",
